{{/*
  The general idea for the zero downtime database server is the following: (defined here and in statefulset.yaml)
    StatefulSet's pod 0 is the main database server that runs normally and pod 1 is the "secondary" database server
    that only runs when 0 is being updated. Pod 1 in its startup clusters on the database server of pod 0 (copies it). The zero downtime (for
    Rosette Server, the following is not true for the Key Management Console) is achieved by pod 1 being able to serve read requests
    while pod 0 updates. All write requests during this time will be lost, as the database of pod 1 is discarded.
    
    This hook basically queries pod 0's template and wait's until the pod updates (there is label that matches the helm revision number)
    and then waits for the database to be available again, before issuing a scale down to one replica. This can lead to 2 scenarios
  
    1. install/api-keys enabled after being disabled/rollback to enabled from apikeys disabled:
      - The StatefulSet cannot find itself in the cluster, it creates with two replica
      - The StatefulSet creates pod 0, it is immediately labeled with the matching revision number.
      - Rosette Server pods and this hook wait until it becomes available
      - The StatefulSet is scaled to size 1, pod 1 will start to create but will almost immediately terminate as well. 
        Tried with only startin with a single replica in this scenario, but on rollbacks to this state it will not repeat
        the check for the statefulset being present in the cluster

    2. upgrade/rollback from a state where the apikeys were already enabled:
      - The StatefulSet finds itself in the cluster, it updates its template with two replicas
      - Kubernetes first scales up, and creates pod 1 that copies pod 0. During this pod 0's label is the wrong (previous)
        revision number, so the hook waits for that to change.
      - Pod 1 is started, kubernetes starts upgrading pod 0. Once it is terminated and restarted, its label is going to be
        correct and the hook will continue to wait on the server starting up. During this time Rosette Server pods will work with pod 1
      - Once pod 0 is up it will also start serving requests, and the hook down scales the StatefulSet to 1 replica, terminating pod 1
